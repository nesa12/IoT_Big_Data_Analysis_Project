# IoT_Big_Data_Analysis_Project
The project involves the use of a smart thermostat system to regulate the temperature of a living room, using a temperature sensor and warning alerts for extreme temperatures. A machine learning model is used for temperature forecasting, and a real-time dashboard is implemented to visualize the temperature data. Overall, the project aims to create a comfortable indoor environment and ensure the safety of individuals in extreme temperature conditions.
## Tasks of the project
1. Sense the current ambient temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH).
2. Depending on the current temperature and Relative Humidity, move an indicator on a display gauge to indicate the current heat index classification.
3. Display a visualization of, Current RH data coming from the sensors, Predicted past 12 months RH and Predicted RH 12 months ahead on a Node-RED dashboard. Use the ARIMA model for predictions.
